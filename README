Spring Social Test
==================
This is just a simple Facebook application for showing the currently
logged-in user's details in the Facebook Canvas page.


How to start
-------------
    - Type https://apps.facebook.com/mytestapp-mvthnk/ and
    you will see the currently logged-in user's details such as username, email, etc.


Workflow
---------
When the user accesses https://apps.facebook.com/mytestapp-mvthnk/,
Facebook makes an asynchronous HTTP POST request to http://facebook-app-test-mvthnk.appspot.com/
which is configured in Facebook application settings.

If this is the first time the user accesses your app,
your app redirects him/her to Facebook Login Dialog (not the Facebook login page,
but app login page or grant-permission page)

If the user accepts the Login Dialog (clicks on the Allow button), t
he user is redirected back to your app redirected with the signed_request parameter included.
The signed_request parameter is a decoded string contained user_id, access_token, etc.
The access token is just a short-lived one which is valid for one or two hours
so your app uses the token to make another HTTP request to get a long-lived one.
It may be valid for 24 hours.
The token is then persisted in session to be used for making API calls to Facebook
to perform operations such as publish to stream, email, get user's info, etc.


Your app on Facebook
