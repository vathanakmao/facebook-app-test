Spring Social Test
==================
This is just a simple Facebook application for showing the currently
logged-in user's details in the Facebook Canvas page.
It focuses on how to your app logs into Facebook.
We are using Spring Social API so we don't need to explicitly
make HTTP request to call Facebook APIs and convert the returned
JSON string to an object ourselves.


How to start
-------------
Type https://apps.facebook.com/mytestapp-mvthnk/ and
you will see the currently logged-in user's details such as username, email, etc.


Workflow
---------
When the user accesses https://apps.facebook.com/mytestapp-mvthnk/,
Facebook makes an asynchronous HTTP POST request to http://facebook-app-test-mvthnk.appspot.com/
which is configured in Facebook application settings.

If this is the first time the user accesses your app,
your app redirects him/her to Facebook Login Dialog (not the Facebook login page,
but app login page or grant-permission page)

If the user accepts the Login Dialog (clicks on the Allow button),
he/she is redirected back to the redirect URI with the 'code' param included.
Your app uses that code param to exchange for access token.
The token is then persisted in session to be used for making API calls to Facebook
to perform operations such as publish to stream, email, get user's info, etc.


Your app on Facebook
---------------------
The app is created by the user vathanakmao.atwork@gmail.com
After logging into Facebook, you can see the app settings from
this URL https://developers.facebook.com/apps/304455099666589/summary


Your app on GAE
----------------
- appId: facebook-app-test-mvthnk.appspot.com
- email: vathanakmao.atwork@gmail.com
- APIs:
    . "/" - display currently logged-in user's information
    . "/admin/session/clear" - invalidate session


Maven
-----
mvn clean gae:deploy
mvn release:prepare -Dresume=false


Code
----
See HomeController and FBAuthorizationInterceptor classes
